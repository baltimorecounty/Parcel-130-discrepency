Parcel-130-discrepancy
======================

Abstract: Linework (boundaries) of some parcels and highway rights of way.

This is a snippet of boundary data representing Maryland State Highway Administration rights of way, and private property boundaries. A discrepancy was raised to Baltimore County GIS, and Elliott Plack researched all the surround property boundaries and fit them together. This is the result.

The point of putting this on Github is to test out how 2 point lines and curve segments look in geoJSON.
